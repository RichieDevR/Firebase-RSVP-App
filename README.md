### Firebase RSVP App Demo

This is an application that allows users to RSVP to events.
It stores user data such as emails user ID's message data as well as whether or not a user is going. It also displays the number of users who have rsvp'd to the event and allows authenticated users to view messages left by other authenticated users.

you can visit this application and test it out for yourself by going to  https://bit.ly/3iCh2Tk which will redirect you to the firebase hosted web app.
